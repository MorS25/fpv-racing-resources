# FPV Racing Resources

A list of resources for multi-rotors and FPV racing. See the http://andyshinn.viewdocs.io/fpv-racing-resources/ for the resource index. The site is generated from the files in the `docs` folder.

## Motivation

I found it difficult to find and organize parts while building my first multi-rotors. It seemed like a good idea to try and organize parts and specifications to be able to make decisions on what to buy at a glance.
