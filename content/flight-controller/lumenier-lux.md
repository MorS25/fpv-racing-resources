The Lumenier LUX flight controller provides high quality flight control using the powerful F3 processor along with top of the line hardware. Unleash the capabilities of your FPV Racing Quadcopter with the Lumenier LUX Flight Controller. Achieve gyro refresh rates up to 8kHz (high speed SPI) using popular Betaflight and Raceflight firmware along with ultra low looptimes. The LUX comes with Cleanflight pre-installed.

The Lumenier LUX is a very low profile board allowing it to be mounted in a variety of ways. The board also comes with a set of pin headers you can optionally solder on. Alternatively, signal wires can be soldered directly to the pads to save on size and weight. The LUX supports PPM or Serial RX (including Futaba, FrSky, S.BUS). A signal inverter is already included for S.BUS. Please note: Baseflight firmware is not supported, and PWM input for individual channels is not supported.
