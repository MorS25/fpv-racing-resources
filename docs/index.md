# FPV Racing Resources

Welcome to the FPV Racing Resources documentation. I created this site to gather part and other resources for small FPV multi-rotors. This site thrives on contributions from others so please feel free to open a pull request adding your favorite resources.

# Resources

This site is organized into sections of parts and resources. We try to link between sections when possible to make navigation and related parts easier to find.
